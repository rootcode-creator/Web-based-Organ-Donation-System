# OrganDonation
**Web application to facilitate the Organ Donation process**

 The four entities of this project are doctors, patients, pharmacists and system admin.

**Admin:** Manage the software, facilitate the smooth function of the software and assign the doctor to each case.

**Patient:** Will request an organ when necessary and see the status of his request.

**Doctor:** Analyse each case and approve or reject each case based on reason, necessity and individual case analysis.

**Pharmacist:** Will handle the job of pharmacist and supply the medicine based on the request of the patient. It's more like an online medicine shop where customers will order medicine, and the status of delivery and other related statuses will be shown on both the pharmacist and customer (patient) web portals.

However, a live demonstration of this project is hosted on my website. The live demonstration of this project is on the following link
